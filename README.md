# heart-disease
**Goal:**<br>
Create machine learning models with better accuracies for prediction of heart disease.

**Dataset source:**<br>
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

**Attribute Information:**<br>
1. age:        Age in years
2. sex:        1 = Male; 0 = Female
3. cp:         Chest pain type(4 values)
4. trestbps:   Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. cholserum:  Cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs:        (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) 1 = true; 0 = false
7. restecg:    Resting electrocardiographic results
8. thalach:    Maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang:      Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak:   Stress Test depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope:     The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca:        Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. thal:      (Thalassemia) 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. target:    1, 2, 3, 4 = Presence; 0 = Absence

**Note:**<br>
Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
